= Git to Wordpress Blog

A not so long time ago in a galaxy surprisingly close I had an argument whether our corporate website should be based on wordpress or rather be statically generated from a git repo of markup and plain text formatting. My counter argument was that one would not have to exclude the other, so this project is to be proof that both can be combined.
